# Cloud_Native_Microservice
I have developed a cloud native microservices with added support for REST and Thrift APIs. It is designed to be used during cloud-native development for testing across different APIsâ€“REST, gRPC, and Thrift. It is extensible in support of future functionality (e.g. GraphQL).
